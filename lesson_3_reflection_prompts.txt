When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want others to collaborate on my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because i dont want my files being overwritten without my consent.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is a function specifically for cloning a github repo from someone to your github account.

Clones is whem you clone a repo from github to your local directory on your computer.

Branches is a tree of commits linked together.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

if any changes are made to the local repo then the last known state does not match with our local repo and hence git status shows this to us.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be harder to collaborate without using github as version-controlling would get a lot harder. One possible option would be to setup time slots in which we would decide before time what we are going to do.
