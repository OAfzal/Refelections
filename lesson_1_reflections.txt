HOW TO USE THE COMMAND GIT LOG AND GIT DIFF TO VIEW THE HISTORY OF FILES?

the commands git log allows us to have a look at all the commits History and provides the authors_name, commit ID , date and the commit description.

the commit id's can then be used with the "git diff" to get the differences between two commits. additions and deletions of line in the code.
